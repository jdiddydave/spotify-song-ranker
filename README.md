# Spotify Discography Ranker
### Log in with your spotify account to rank your favorite artists' albums, singles & more.

- Welcome to Kyle's Spotify Discography Ranker. This application will allow you to log in with your
    spotify account and rank your favorite artists' entire discography. This is not a bracket style ranking system.
    We use a merge-sort type algorithm to rank every possible combination of tracks as efficently as possible.
- This application isn't limited to an artists' entire discography either, you can rank indivdual albums, a set
    of albums, just singles, etc. You can filter down your favorite artists' songs to just the ones you want to rank.
- After you've finished a ranking, feel free to share your finalized list with friends, download the list & more.
- This application is still under review by Spotify's API team to allow for any spotify user to login and begin ranking without being added to an "approved user list".
    If you don't want to wait and want to start ranking your favorite artists' songs right now, feel free to contact me to be added to the "approved user list". My
    discord is @spacelampsix (same with twitter).

### TODO
- Make the website spotify friendly (so they approve it)
- confirm delete when deleting ranking
- fix styling on home icon
- add toggle switch to toggle between widget and album art when ranking
- loader for when loading a lot of songs
- better filtering on large song lists.
