### Log in with your spotify account to rank your favorite artists' albums, singles & more.

- Welcome to songrank.dev. This application will allow you to log in with your
    spotify account and rank your favorite artists' entire discography. This is not a bracket style ranking system.
    We use a merge-sort type algorithm to rank every possible combination of tracks as efficently as possible.
- This application isn't limited to an artists' entire discography either, you can rank indivdual albums, a set
    of albums, just singles, etc. You can filter down your favorite artists' songs to just the ones you want to rank.
- After you've finished a ranking, feel free to share your finalized list with friends, download the list & more.
